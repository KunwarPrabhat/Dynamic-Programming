// The Climbing Stairs problem is a classic example of dynamic programming, where the goal is to find how many distinct ways you can climb to the top of a staircase given that you can take either 1 step, 2 steps, or any other valid step size.
// 
// Problem Statement:
// You are climbing a staircase with n steps. Each time you can either climb 1 step, 2 steps, or k steps (where k can be any valid step size). How many distinct ways can you reach the top?
