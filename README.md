# How to Contribute

Welcome to the project! Here's a quick guide on how you can contribute effectively.

## Steps to Contribute
1. Create a folder with a meaningful name related to your contribution.
2. Add files inside the folder as per the structure shown below.

## Folder and File Structure
Your folder and file structure should look like this:

```
DP -
    |
    |___feb
    |     |---1Q.cpp
    |     |---2Q.cpp
    |     |---1Q.java
    |
    |_____coin problem
```

### Explanation of the Structure
- **DP**: The main folder containing all contributions related to "Dynamic Programming" (DP).
- **feb**: A subfolder representing a specific topic, month, or category.
  - `1Q.cpp`: The first question or problem solved in C++.
  - `2Q.cpp`: The second question or problem solved in C++.
  - `1Q.java`: The first question or problem solved in Java.
- **coin problem**: Another subfolder for a specific problem, e.g., "Coin Change Problem."

## Guidelines

- Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
- Include comments in your code to explain your logic.
- If you add a new topic, ensure it is well-organized and follows the folder structure.
